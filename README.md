# Telecom_Data_Curn_Prediction_with-Neural-network
 
 What are we doing?
 
 Here we are learning to do Churn Prediction on Telecom dataset with Neural network and also HyperParameter tuning to learn how to select number of Hidden layers and hiddn Neurons

What is churn prediction model?
Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service. ... Upload that data to a prediction service that automatically creates a “predictive model.” Use the model on each current customer to predict whether they are at risk of leaving.

We are using:
Library :- Keras Classifier ,GridSearch CV,ANN
